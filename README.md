### Authors: Chase Romano, Kirk Mason, and Nityanand Kore

This app allows policy makers and school officials in the Charlotte region to investigate the student diversity landscape for 
the area's public school system from 2008 to 2020.

To view the live app go to https://kirkmason.shinyapps.io/CMS_Diversity_v03/.

All code used to create the app is in the folder entitled <em>CMS_Diversity_v03</em>. If you wish to run the app from R Studio instead of going to the above link, you can use the following steps:
<ol>

  <li>Open <em>CMS_Diversity.Rproj</em> in R Studio</li>
  <li>Open app.R</li>
  <li>Click "Run App" in the upper right corner of the code panel</li>
  <li>(optional) Click "Open in Browser" in the upper left corner of the app window if you wish to view in browser</li>
</ol>
